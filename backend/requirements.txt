# For Argon2 hashes you can use argon2-cffi or passlib[argon2].
# passlib is just a wrapper for argon2-cffi and requires it.
# For simplicity & faster updates, use argon2-cffi directly.
# For a consistent interface to multiple hashing algorithms
# (like bcrypt), use passlib.  Used in ./app/core/security.py.
# argon2-cffi automatically also installs argon2-cffi-bindings
