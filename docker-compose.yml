    # This means that changes to code in "app" are immediately reflected in the 
    # running container.
    # Useful for development if 'CMD' also includes the "--reload" option.
    # This avoids mounting other directories (backend/tests, backend/experiments)
    # in the container. 
    # For production, you want to remove this.
